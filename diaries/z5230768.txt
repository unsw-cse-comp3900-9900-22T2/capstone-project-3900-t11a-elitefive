Week 1
Formed our group of 5 and discussed what we all want to focus on programming 
wise; who wants to work on database/frontend/backend. I took on the role as 
scrum master and created the Jira page.

I suggested the idea of making a competitive "Yavalath" website. We wrote up the
initial proposal as a group and discussed what extra features and functionality
we want to contribute to individually. I made sure that everyone had something
that they were excited to work on during the term. 

My week mainly consisted of revising, rewriting and emailing the draft proposal 
to the lecturer and lab assistant until it was approved. I got our custom 
project approved on Sunday.

During this time we fleshed out what our project was going to deliver and we 
have a good understanding of what we want to build this term.

These are the meetings we are planning for next week:
- Group meeting (Finalise project design and functions)
- UI meeting
- Database meeting
- Programming stack (Get a prototype working)


Week 2
I organised the group meetings this week and delegated tasks that need to be 
completed this week. I finished setting up the Github/Jira pages for our group 
and posted them in our group discord for everyone to access along with other 
helpful links to keep track of our design documents.

In the Tuesday group meeting I outlined everything we needed to achieve in the 
project and made sure we all understood what we were working on this term. 
Together we brainstormed the layout of the website and what functions we are 
going to provide. We also worked on 'explaining the project purpose' to make it 
clear what we will be delivering at the end of the term.

On Wednesday, I created a diagram to show the use cases of the website based on 
what we made on Tuesday. I also wrote descriptions to explain each function. 
I uploaded this document to our confluence. Jacky X worked on getting uwebsockets 
set up with C++ but was running into some problems. I helped with some of the 
linking issues and we will be trying to set this up on Docker later.

On Thursday I attended the UI meeting with Jacky X and Yirong. I suggested some 
ideas for some pages and gave feedback on the work they had already done. 
Overall what they have made looks good.

On Saturday we had our database meeting with Jacky J and Sage. We worked on 
creating some diagrams to show what tables we need and how they relate to each 
other. We discussed several approaches for retrieving data in different 
situations. We have made tables for User/friends/match/games/replay/outcomes/comments. 
We need to make a table that stores move sequences.

Next week we need to:
- Setup the Jira Backlog 
- Write report
- Install code stack
- Begin prototyping


Week 3
- Had a meeting on Tuesday after Class with Sage, Jacky X, Jacky J. 
Jacky X and I finialised frontend design during this meeting.
Together we decided on the final functionalities we would provide for our project.

- During the week I tested Jacky X local setup of Docker containing backend/frontend.
It works and will be the main code statck used by everyone in the group for development.

- Talked to Sage and Jacky J about their database design and discussed approaches to implement and support out "snapshot feature"
- Set up User Stories and Storypoints on Jira with Jacky X, Jacky J and Sage.

Throughout the week I worked on various tasks for the report.
- Created final ui interaction flow diagrams based on the frontent mockup design by Jacky X. 
- Created node based UI interaction chart to show how all the webpages connect to each other
- Had several meetings with Jacky J, Sage and Jacky X to go over User Stories.
- Worked on report background, user stories and diagram formatting.
- Finalised report with Jacky J, to make sure all objectives in the project were included.



Week 4
Team meeting on Tuesday - Everyone is official setup using docker and can access frontend and backend.
Tickets and tasks have been distributed amongst all of us.
- Jacky X and Yirong are doing frontend work.
- Sage and Jacky J are doing Database work.
- I am doing game logic backend work.

I mainly worked on backend logic this week. I created the yavalath board logic which stores which player
has placed a hex on the tile. I also set up some vector math to aid in quickly navigating the board to check
for game win/loss conditions. Jacky J used this system to write the game over logic. This system will be useful
for AI work.

I worked on setting up socketing between client and server. This will need to be used during the game to give
live updates to all clients who are participating.

Throughout the week, we all participated in many discord calls to go over what needed to be done.

Next week we need to demo and will be working more on functionality to do with networking and AI.

Week 5
We had our demo on Tuesday and it seems like it went fairly well. We held our retrospective no long after the demo.
Our group was pretty happy with what we got done and we planned what we were going to work on for the next sprint.
During the week I have been rewriting the backend system to be more inline with the replay system, so we can
easily track moves played in the game and give it to the database to store.
- Rewrote the game system
- Wrote BitBoard representation which can compresses a board state into a 64 bit number
- Rewriting AI to be more flexible with othe rgame modes
- Fixed Backend directory structure to be more organised
Also go vscode working with our project now.

Week 7
We all individually worked on our tasks and tickets to get functionality done for demo 2.
- I refactored game logic code to be easier to deal with for ai purposes.
- I reworked on AI logic to improve the logic and make it more difficult. The AI does a proper tree search now based on a
simple heuristic.
- Worked on API logic to serve data from database to frontend.
- Developed websocketing logic for multiplayer gameplay.
- Also made it so many users can play different games on the same server at the same time without interfering with each other.
- Implemented basic elo and used Jacky J database calls.
During this I also reviewed some of the frontend changes with Jacky X and gave pointers on what needed to be implemented and changed.

Week 8
Lots of ground work coding to serve functionality in our last sprint.
- Refactoring the waiting room logic so we can expand it for more gamemodes and players.
- Refactoring the multiplayer socketing code to handle different game modes.
- Lots of improvements to AI to give settings for difficulty changes.
- Changed some frontend colours and function calls that handle tile placements.

Week 9
This week is mainly focus on finishing up all of the functionality for the Yavalath website. Overall I 
have focused on setting up JSON endpoints for frontend to connect to. I have been delegating tasks to 
Jacky J and Jacky X to make sure we finish everything.
In the meantime, sage has been working on account tickets and setting up the project on CSE machines.

This week I worked on a variety of tasks - Here are a few highlights:
Frontend
-> Displaying Potholes on frontend
-> Setting up usestate on frontend to display three player replays

Networking
-> Networking for Triples
-> Friend invite system networking and emulation in python for testing
-> Fixing server crash with AI rooms after multiple play throughs

Backend
-> Worked on lots of endpoints to give out data on replays and profiles
-> Worked on social feed 

Game logic
-> Potholes gamemode added
-> Tripiles gamemode added

AI changes
-> Reworked AI to have difficulty adjustments
    -> Easy is semi-random with win/loss detection.
    -> Medium is heuristic based.
    -> Hard lets the bot go first and heuristic based.
-> Improved Heuristic of AI in classic game for the "hardest" difficulty
-> Made an AI for Triples that is actually functional.

- Many calls and creating tickets for frontend to organise what functionality
needed to be worked on.
