Week 1

David C and I discussed project ideas before class, and he introduced the 'Yavalath' game idea to me.
We formed the group of 5 in class and presented the idea to the group.
During class, we brainstormed some features, functionality and objectives for our project for the Custom Project Proposal.
We distributed front-end, back-end and database responsibilities to each member in class.
David and I reviewed and revised the Custom Project Proposal remotely.
After several e-mail exchanges between David and the lecturer, our custom project idea was approved accepted.

For next week:
- Group meeting to solidify project functionality and features
- UI & Database meeting
- Programming stack (prototype)

Week 2

On Tuesday (after class), we had a group meeting to solidfy project functionality, features and goals.
During this meeting, we had an extensive discussion to develop a simple 'project description'. Sage and I had some initial discussions related to database design for the project.
On Thursday, I participated in the latter section of the UI meeting with David, Jacky X and Yirong and provided some light feedback.
On Saturday, David, Sage and I had our database meeting. We discussed and began developing the database schema and created simple draft diagrams (ER & Relational).
In particular, we went into great detail regarding the storage of a user's ELO and how we were going to represent this in the database.
We have a good foundation for several tables such as Users, Friends, Matches, Games, Replays, Outcomes and ReplayComments.
However, we still have yet to decide on specific details for some tables. For example, how to store move sequences (or board states) under Replays.

For next week:
- Set up and begin coding
- Begin and progress on report writing
- Elaborate on database design and queries
