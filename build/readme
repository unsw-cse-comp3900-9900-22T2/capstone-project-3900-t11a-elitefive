ENVIRONMENT
===========
Our project uses the provided Lubuntu 20.4.1 LTS image using a VM. 
We verified the build using VMware Workstation 16 player.

Note: the VM runs everything our website slower then running the project natively in docker or on a computer.

You can also locate the project on our github here:
https://github.com/unsw-cse-comp3900-9900-22T2/capstone-project-3900-t11a-elitefive

All the src code for lubuntu is inside the build folder. You can also find it in the "build.zip" folder.

DOWNLOAD PROJECT
=================
Extract the `build` folder onto the desktop.
In the build folder you should have the following files:
	backend/
	database/
	frontend/
	install.sh
	restart.sh
	readme

INSTALLATION (How to run the project)
======================================
Note: This is performing a first time setup and installing all relevant packages on lubuntu

0. Log into Lubuntu 20.4.1 LTS.
	Virtual Machine Credentials:
		Username: lubuntu
		Password: lubuntu

1. Open QTerminal

2. cd to the directory where you extracted the `build` folder.

3. In the build folder you should have the following files:
	backend/
	database/
	frontend/
	restart.sh
	readme

4. Run the following command: 
	sudo sh install.sh
	enter password 'lubuntu' if prompted

5. Wait for installation and build to complete. (This will take approxiately 15-20 minutes)
   This script installs and configures the following:
   		- postgresql
   		- c++ and cmake
   		- mail server
   		- nodejs

6. Installation is complete when you see the last few lines in the terminal say:
	"Shell program: "npm start"
	("npm", "start")

7. Press enter a few times on the same QTerminal so you can type commands again.

8. Run the following command: 
	./backend/server

9. Open firefox and type 'localhost:3000'

10. You should see the yavalath website. 
Otherwise npm is still launching setup scripts in the new window.

INSTALLATION FAQ & ADVICE:
===========================
- During setup a new terminal window will be opened. This is the frontend server. 
Do not close this window.

- You can safey IGNORE the following firefox prompt popups:
"Your Firefox profile cannot be loaded. It may be missing or inaccessible."
(This error pops up 3 times, just hit okay each time and it will stop)

- If you see the Firefox warning above that means that the frontend server is being built.

- You need to wait for the script to finish entirely before the project will work. 
Installation is complete when a new terminal is opened. 

- If you accidently close all terminals after installation you can set up the frontend server and backend server as follows.
1. Open two seperate QTerminal in the same build folder as before
	Terminal (1): Run `sudo sh restart.sh` 
	Terminal (2): Run `./backend/server`


ACCESSING THE YAVALATH WEBSITE
===============================
0: Verify that the new frontend terminal window is open. 
1: ./backend/server (if you haven't already)
2: Open firefox and type in the url - `localhost:3000`

If you accidently closed the new terminal window, open a new instance and navigate to build/frontend. Type `npm start`

MULTIPLAYER INSTRUCTIONS
==========================
To test a multiplayer game open a new private window in firefox by pressing:
CTRL + SHIFT + P
Navigate to localhost:3000

You should have two browser windows open
1. Firefox
2. Firefox in a private window (CTRL + SHIFT + P)
Log into two different accounts for both firefox sessions (1) and (2).


Note: Session tokens on this website are tied to one browser. If you open multiple tabs in the browser, they will all be logged into the same account. 
"Icognito" mode make the site think it is in a different browser session. All icognito tabs will be logged into the same account.


To simulate a TRIPLES game, you need to open three seperate browser instants.
1 - Firefox
2 - Firefox in a private window (CTRL + SHIFT + P)
3 - Google Chrome (You will have to install this)
