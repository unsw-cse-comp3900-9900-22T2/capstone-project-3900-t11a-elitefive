ENVIRONMENT
===========
Our project uses the provided LUBUNTU image using a VM. We verified the build using VMware Workstation 16 player.

You can locate the project on our github:
https://github.com/unsw-cse-comp3900-9900-22T2/capstone-project-3900-t11a-elitefive
The relevant folder for lubuntu is "build"

DOWNLOAD PROJECT
=================
Extract the `build` folder onto the desktop.


INSTALLATION (How to run the project)
======================================
Note: This is performing a first time setup and installing all relevant packages on lubuntu

0. Log into lubuntu. Password: lubuntu

1. Open QTerminal

2. cd to the directory where you extracted the build folder.

3. In the build folder you should have the following files:
	backend/
	database/
	frontend/
	install.sh

4. Run the following command: 
	sudo sh install.sh
	enter password 'lubuntu'

5. Wait for installation and build to complete. (Approxiately 15-20 minutes)
   This will take approximately 20 minutes because it installs and configures the following
   		- postgresql
   		- c++ and cmake
   		- mail server
   		- nodejs

6. Once installation is complete run the following command: 
	./backend/server

7. Everything should be running.

8. Open firefox and type 'localhost:3000'

INSTALLATION FAQ & ADVICE:
===========================
- During setup a new terminal will be opened. This is the frontend server. 
Do not close this window.

- You need to wait for the script to finish entirely. 
Installation is complete when a new terminal is opened. 

- You can safey IGNORE the following firefox prompt popups:
"Your Firefox profile cannot be loaded. It may be missing or inaccessible."
(This error pops up 3 times, just hit okay each time and it will stop)

- If you see the Firefox warning above that means that the frontend server is being built.

- If you accidently close all terminals after installation you can set up the frontend server and backend server as follows.
1. Open two seperate QTerminal in the same build folder as before
	Terminal (1): Run `sudo sh restart.sh` 
	Terminal (2): Run `./backend/server`

MULTIPLAYER INSTRUCTIONS
==========================
To test a multiplayer game open a new private window in firefox by pressing:
CTRL + SHIFT + P
Navigate to localhost:3000

You should have two browser windows open
1. Firefox
2. Firefox in a private window (CTRL + SHIFT + P)
Log into two different accounts for both firefox sessions (1) and (2).


Note: Session tokens on this website are tied to one browser. If you open multiple tabs in the browser, they will all be logged into the same account. 
"Icognito" mode make the site think it is in a different browser session. All icognito tabs will be logged into the same account.


To simulate a TRIPLES game, you need to open three seperate browser instants.
1 - Firefox
2 - Firefox in a private window (CTRL + SHIFT + P)
3 - Google Chrome (You will have to install this)
